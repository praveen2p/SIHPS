## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
Locating an e-waste facility requires considering various factors such as proximity to urban centers, transportation infrastructure, environmental regulations, and community acceptance. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you:

Research Regulations: Understand the regulatory environment regarding e-waste management in your region. Regulations may dictate the requirements for handling, disposal, and recycling of electronic waste.

Identify Suitable Locations: Look for areas zoned for industrial or waste management activities. Proximity to transportation hubs like highways, railways, or ports can facilitate easy movement of e-waste to and from the facility.

## Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript (consider a framework like React or Vue.js for a more complex UI) Backend: Python (with Django or Flask framework) or Node.js (with Express framework) Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL Maps Integration: Leverage a mapping service API like Google Maps Platform or Leaflet


## Dependencies
The application relies on a database to store e-waste facility information and user location data (anonymously). Integration with a mapping service API is necessary to display facilities on a map.
